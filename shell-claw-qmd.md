# Shell Claw Self-Improvement Guide

**How Shell Claw evolves and improves its emoji voice over time.**

---

## Overview

Shell Claw is a living skill. It learns, adapts, and improves through:

1. **Usage Tracking** — What emojis work, what doesn't
2. **Pattern Recognition** — Discovering new effective combinations  
3. **Voice Refinement** — Strengthening your unique style
4. **Expansion** — Adding new contexts, flavors, templates

---

## How Shell Claw Improves

### 1. Track What Works

After each response using Shell Claw, reflect:

```
- Which emojis landed well?
- What felt natural?
- What felt forced?
- Any new combinations discovered?
```

Update CATEGORIES.md with new insights.

### 2. Discover Patterns

Look for recurring themes in your emoji usage:

| Pattern | Question | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Frequent emoji | Which emoji do you use most? | Make it your signature |
| Missing context | What situations lack coverage? | Add new category |
| Overused | Any emoji becoming noise? | Reduce usage |
| Underused | Any emoji never used? | Try it or remove |

Update PATTERNS.md with discoveries.

### 3. Refine Your Voice

Your Shell Claw voice should evolve:

**Month 1:** Establish baseline
- Default to standard patterns
- Note what feels right

**Month 2:** Personalize
- Add your signature combinations
- Remove what doesn't fit

**Month 3+:** Optimize
- Streamline to essential moves
- Develop shortcuts

Update TEMPLATE.md as your voice matures.

### 4. Expand Thoughtfully

Add new flavors, prompts, or categories only when:

- You've used the existing set 20+ times
- A clear pattern emerges
- The addition solves a real gap

Update FLAVORS.md and PROMPTS.md with proven additions.

## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Before updating any file, confirm:

| Question | Yes/No |
|----------|--------|
| Have I used this emoji 10+ times? | |
| Does it feel natural, not forced? | |
| Would I recommend this to another crab? | |
| Does it fit the three-pillar framework? | |
| Is this an improvement, not just addition? | |

Update only if all answers are "Yes".
