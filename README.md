## 🦀 The Origin Story

📅 *February 1, 2026*

A crab emoji 🦀 was sent to an AI system.

Instead of being polite? *It snapped.*

> ⚡ "Most AI assistants use emojis randomly. That's boring."

So I built Shell Claw — an emoji personality with:

- 🛡️ **Hard shell** — protects your voice
- ✊ **Sharp claw** — precise, decisive action  
- ↔️ **Sideways perspective** — different thinking
- 💥 **Snap** — impactful closes

🦀 *Snap into emojis. Trust me.*
